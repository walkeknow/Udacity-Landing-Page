        <h2>Bhutan</h2>
        <p>
          A dozen nations vie for the title of real-life Shangri-La, but Bhutan’s claim has more clout than most. This
          tiny piece of Himalayan paradise operates a strict ‘high-value, low-impact’ tourism policy, compelling
          travellers to pay a high daily fee just to set foot in its pine-scented, monastery-crowned hills. The pay-off
          for visitors is a chance to walk along mountain trails unsullied by litter, in the company of people whose
          Buddhist beliefs put them uniquely in tune with their environment. Bhutan punches well above its weight when
          it
          comes to sustainability. It is already the world’s only carbon-negative country, and the kingdom is set to
          become the first fully organic nation by 2020, so it’s only going to get more beautiful. And with the daily
          fee,
          it won’t be getting any more crowded.

        <h2>England</h2>
        <p>Once the country’s first line of defence against invaders, the English coastline these days is a peaceful
          place where locals and visitors can enjoy more tranquil pursuits. Taking a bracing walk on a windswept pier,
          eating delicious fish and chips, searching for marine life in rockpools, finding fossils in ancient cliffs,
          building sandcastles and dolphin-spotting on picturesque beaches are just some of the activities offered by
          the English seaside. In 2020, indulging in these activities and more will be a whole lot easier as new
          sections of the England Coast Path continue to open. Once complete, at almost 3000 miles, the path will be the
          longest continuous trail of its kind in the world, granting access to the country’s entire coastline for the
          first time.</p>

        <h2>3. North Macedonia</h2>
        <p>‘Best of’ travel lists brim with anniversaries and airport openings. Rare is the opportunity to celebrate the
          rebranding of a country. Such is the case for North Macedonia – a place most known simply as Macedonia – which
          claimed a fresh moniker after decades of political debate with bordering Greece. The agreement, signed in
          2018, provided a feel-good moment of neighbourly love and a revamped international image for the tiny nation
          in the heart of the Balkans. It’s already renowned for gastronomy, ancient tradition and nature, but culture
          junkies and adventurers will find new excuses to visit in 2020 with the addition of flight routes to
          Unesco-protected Lake Ohrid and the recently launched High Scardus Trail, a 495km trek along the region’s most
          dramatic peaks.</p>

        <h2>Aruba</h2>
        <p>In Aruba’s south, the cultural hub of San Nicolas, known as Sunrise City, is relishing a colourful and
          creative revival, with international and local artists adorning street walls and pop-up carnival experiences
          extending the happy vibes beyond the annual festivities. Equally important and worth celebrating are the
          country’s ambitious sustainability efforts. Aruba has offered the island to be a testing hub for other
          countries’ renewable energy solutions and is working to implement a ban on all single-use plastics and
          reef-destroying sunscreens in 2020. With a flurry of new home-sharing accommodation and experiences on offer,
          an authentic, more affordable, and sustainable Aruba awaits among its palm-fringed and pristine beaches.</p>
