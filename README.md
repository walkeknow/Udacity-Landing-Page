## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

-There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.
-Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
-Styling has been added for active states. (listening for an event for sections to become active)
-It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
-When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
